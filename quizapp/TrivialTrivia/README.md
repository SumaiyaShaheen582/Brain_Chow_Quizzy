# TrivialTrivia
Remake of "trivial trivia" with native Android code and a truer implementation of Model-View-Presenter paradigm.

## Installation
Import into Android Studio, build and run. Alternatively, install the last stable version from the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.avinashdavid.trivialtrivia)

## Description
This is a remake of my first published app, which was called "Trivial Trivia". On the Play Store, this version of the app can be found under the name "Trivial Trivia 2". 
The purpose of this publish is to exhibit the programming involved in the making of this app. 
Along the way, I have learned a lot about testing in Android development, which I used extensively while setting up the backend of the app before creating the UI. 
Additionally, I have become more familiar with services in Android, and how to use them more seamlessly with the UI by utilizing model classes in conjunction with services to collect, store and present data. As part of the data level of the app, this app also allowed me to further my grasp on using SQLite and ContentResolver to store and modify local data.
Finally, this project has allowed me to begin to dive into various UI customizations and niceties available in the Android API, like RecyclerView, activity transitions and XML drawables.
